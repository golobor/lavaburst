abstract = {MOTIVATION: The level of sequence conservation between related nucleic acids or proteins often varies considerably along the sequence. Both regions with high variability (mutational hot-spots) and regions of almost perfect sequence identity may occur in the same pair of molecules. The reliability of an alignment therefore strongly depends on the level of local sequence similarity. Especially in regions of high variability, many alignments of almost equal quality exist, and the optimal alignment is highly arbitrary. RESULTS: We discuss two approaches which deal with the inherent ambiguity of the alignment problem based on the computation of the partition function over all canonical pairwise alignments. The ensemble of possible alignments can be described by the probabilities P(ij) of a match between position i in the first and position j in the second sequence. Alternatively, we introduce a probabilistic backtracking procedure that generates ensembles of suboptimal alignments with correct statistical weights. A comparison between structure based alignments and large samples of stochastic alignments shows that the ensemble contains correct alignments with significant probabilities even though the optimal alignment deviates significantly from the structural alignment. Ensembles of suboptimal alignments obtained by stochastic backtracking can be used as input to any bioinformatics method based on pairwise alignment in order to gain reliability information not available from a single optimal alignment.

@article{Filippova2014,
abstract = {Chromosome conformation capture experiments have led to the discovery of dense, contiguous, megabase-sized topological domains that are similar across cell types and conserved across species. These domains are strongly correlated with a number of chromatin markers and have since been included in a number of analyses. However, functionally-relevant domains may exist at multiple length scales. We introduce a new and efficient algorithm that is able to capture persistent domains across various resolutions by adjusting a single scale parameter. The ensemble of domains we identify allows us to quantify the degree to which the domain structure is hierarchical as opposed to overlapping, and our analysis reveals a pronounced hierarchical structure in which larger stable domains tend to completely contain smaller domains. The identified novel domains are substantially different from domains reported previously and are highly enriched for insulating factor CTCF binding and histone marks at the boundaries.},

@article{Girvan2002,
abstract = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known--a collaboration network and a food web--and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},
